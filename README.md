# RB3Builder
A simple script that will assemble a Rock Band 3 controller profile for RPCS3.

# Setup
- This is intended for use on a Steam Deck or otherwise with Steam Input. The profiles are configured to detect generic Xbox 360 controllers in their respective ports, which is what Steam Input does.
- You will also need to configure the location of your RPCS3 executable and directory in `create.sh`.

# Instrument Support
- Xbox 360 Rock Band Guitars (Stratocaster, Hofner, etc)
- Xbox 360 Guitar Hero Guitars (Les Paul, etc)
- Xbox 360 Rock Band Pro Drums (The Beatles, etc)
- Xbox 360 Guitar Hero Drums
- Vocals (Generic Controllers)

# Usage
- In Steam, you want to make sure that RB3 launches with this first.
- Once you are done assigning what instruments you are using with this script, use Steam to set the controllers to the correct ports, Steam is just screwy.
